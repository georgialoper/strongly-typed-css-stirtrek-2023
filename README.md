# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Thanks for attending *Strongly-typed CSS with Vanilla-extract* during CodeMash 2023.

This [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) app powered the presentation slides.

Also check out the [strongly-typed-css-with-vanilla-extract](https://github.com/georgialoper/strongly-typed-css-with-vanilla-extract) repo - a minimal webpack + [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) app from which all vanilla-extract code examples in this presentation where were pulled from.

Hopefully you find this helpful! ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting started
