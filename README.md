# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Thanks for attending *Strongly-typed CSS with Vanilla-extract* during CodeMash 2023.

This repo holds the [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) app that powered the presentation slides, but they can be viewed in .pdf form [here](https://github.com/georgialoper/vanilla-extract-codemash-2023/blob/main/slides-export.pdf).

Also check out the [strongly-typed-css-with-vanilla-extract](https://github.com/georgialoper/strongly-typed-css-with-vanilla-extract) repo - a minimal webpack + [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) app from which all vanilla-extract code examples in this presentation where were pulled from.

Hopefully you find this helpful! ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting started

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
