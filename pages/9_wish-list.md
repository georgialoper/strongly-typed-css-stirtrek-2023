<!--
 - Performance
   - for our end users
 - DevX
   - easily surface our tokens in JS and keep in sync with our classes
 - Scoped styles
   - no global scope 
 - Typesafe
   - author, delete, refactor with confidence
 - Runtime theming
   - Depending on your context
 - Atomic styles
   - We want that composition and finite stylesheet as much as possible.
