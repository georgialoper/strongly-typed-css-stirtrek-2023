<!--

Hot Take - I think we're in the Golden Age of JavaScript right now, especially in terms of DevX with all the tools that assist us in our IDEs.

We have typesaftey with TypeScript and Zod.

We have linting against common errors or mistakes with eslint.

We have code formatting with prettier.

and all the plugins those tools come with.

With recent innovations from the React team as well as Next and Remix, we're entering the golden age of JavaScript in terms of performance as well.

It's actually hard not to write consistent, robust, performant web applications in this day and age using all these tools.

<!--
That is until you have to write CSS.

Writing CSS has always felt like you need a crystal ball to be able to read the mind of every developer who wrote CSS in your application before you, and every designer who will ever want to re-skin your app.

I still remember, as a junior engineer, I would have these 2 senior engineers arguing over their interpretation of BEM on my pull requests.

Between fighting the global nature of CSS, the mental overhead of learning the existing classes or arbitrary naming conventions, to bundle size and browser performance, to just straight up spelling errors.

It still doesn't feel like we've way to write maintainable, performant, refactorable, consistent CSS.
