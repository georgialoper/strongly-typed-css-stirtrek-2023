<!--
We're really in the golden age of JavaScript. Especially in terms of DevX, and we're really starting to get there in terms of performance with innovations by Remix and Next.

We're in the Golden Age of JavaScript right now, especially in terms of DevX with all the tools that assist us in our IDEs.

We have typesaftey with TypeScript and Zod.

We have linting against common error or mistakes with eslint.

We have code formatting with prettier.

We have all the plugins those tools come with.

And with recent innovations from the React team as well as Next and Remix, we're entering the golden age of JavaScript in terms of performance as well.

It's actually hard not to write consistent, robust, performant web applications in this day and age using all these tools.

That is until you have to write CSS.

Writing CSS has always felt like you need a crystal ball to be able to read the mind of every developer who wrote CSS in your application before you, and every designer who will ever want to re-skin your application.

I still remember, as a junior engineer, I would have 2 senior engineers argue over their interpretation of BEM on my pull requests.

Between fighting the global nature of CSS, the mental overhead of learning the existing classes or arbitrary naming conventions, to bundle size and browser performance, to just straight up spelling errors.

It still doesn't feel like way to write maintainable, performant, refactorable, consistent CSS.
